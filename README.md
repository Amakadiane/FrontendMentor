## My process
Firstly, i had to set up an html page using mostly semantic elements and tags.
Secondarily, paired the HTML elements with css properties. Mostly, i had to make use of the normal CSS.
Made use of CSS3 but just few.
### Built with
- HTML markup
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
-max-width









### What I learned

Though the entire project wasn't as easy as it looks. i did tried my best. The main thing is trying and not giving up. Having no learnt many Responsive CSS or CSS3, i made sure j use most CSS to mg best of knowledge.



```html
<footer>
  <aside>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: cyan;
  white-space: pre-line;
}











### Continued development
Need more practice on Semantic HTML5 and responsive CSS and CSS3
